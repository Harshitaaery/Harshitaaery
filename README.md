# Hi, I'm Harshita

- I break things, then fix them with code
- Built EventCraft (ticket booking app) & ThemeYOU (AI+AR home d√©cor idea that actually got noticed) for fun
- Studying CSE('26), figuring out Cloud, DevOps & all that jazz.  
- Don't be alarmed when you watch me pushing random commits at 2 AM.
- Looking to build a lot more in the future
